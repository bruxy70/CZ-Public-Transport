# End of free API trial?
It looks like CHAPS made some change in December 2019, and the API does not work anymore without a valid `userid` (eventhoug the documentation states that `userid` parameter is optional). Let's wait what the future brings.

# Czech Public Transport

The `CZ-Public-Transport` component is a Home Assistant custom sensor that finds Public Transport connections in the Czech Republic. It uses test version of CRWS - an REST API managed by CHAPS s.r.o. The test version is unfortunately limited to limited combinations of connections - ABCz, witch is PID (Pra≈æsk√° Integrovan√° Doprava) without trains. The full version would require client ID, but CHAPS does not provide that to public as far as I know. I did write them an email about my intention to write this sensor, but they did not respond.

## Installation

### MANUAL INSTALLATION
1. Download the
   [latest release](https://github.com/bruxy70/CZ-Public-Transport/releases/latest).
2. Unpack the release and copy the `custom_components/cz_pub_tran` directory
   into the `custom_components` directory of your Home Assistant
   installation.
3. Configure the `cz_pub_tran` sensor.
4. Restart Home Assistant.

### INSTALLATION VIA HACS
1. Ensure that [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/) is installed.
2. Search for and install the "CZ Public Transport" integration.
3. Configure the `cz_pub_tran` sensor.
4. Restart Home Assistant.

## Configuration
There are 2 ways to configure the integration:
1. Using *Config Flow*: in `Configuration/Integrations` click on the `+` button, select `CZ Public Transport` and configure the sensor (prefered). If you configure the integration using Config Flow, you can change the entity_name, name and change the sensor parameters from the Integrations configuration. The changes are instant and do not require HA restart.
2. Using *YAML*: Add `cz_pub_tran` sensor in your `configuration.yaml` as per the example below:

Or you can use combination of both. The configuration of `user_id`, `detail_format`, `scan_interval` and `force_refresh_period` is currently possible only in *YAML*. To configure these, only add these paramaters and no `sensors` configuration, then configure sensors using Home Assistant GUI.

```yaml
# Simple example of configuration.yaml (sensors will be named automatically)
cz_pub_tran:
  sensors:
    - origin: "Zbraslavsk√© n√°mƒõst√≠"
      destination: "Poliklinika Barrandov"
    - origin: "Cernosice, zel.zast."
      destination: "Florenc"

# Complex example of configuration.yaml
cz_pub_tran:
  user_id: <no idea where to get one>
  scan_interval: 120
  force_refresh_period: 0
  detail_format: HTML
  sensors:
    - name: "Zbraslav-Barrandov"
      origin: "Zbraslavsk√© n√°mƒõst√≠"
      destination: "Poliklinika Barrandov"
    - name: "ƒåerno≈°ice-Florenc"
      origin: "Cernosice, zel.zast."
      destination: "Florenc"

```

### CONFIGURATION PARAMETERS
| Attribute | Optional | Description
|:---------|-----------|-----------
| `cz_pub_tran` | No | This is the platform name
| `user_id` | Yes | ...if you have one (if you do, please let me know where you got it. Thanks!). Otherwise it will use the trial account. 
| `scan_interval` | Yes | The sensor refresh rate (seconds)<br/>**Default**: 60
| `force_refresh_period` | Yes | The sensor will skip update if there is already scheduled connection. But, every n-th refresh, it will force the update, to check delay changes. This can be disabled by setting this to 0.<br/>**Default**: 5  **Range**: 0-60
| `description_format` | Yes | The **description** attribute can be rendered in 2 different formats:<br/>- **text**: plain text, each connection on 1 line (**default**)<br/>- **HTML**: HTML table
| `name` | Yes | Sensor friendly name.<br/>**Default**: cz_pub_tran
| `origin` | No | Name of the originating bus stop
| `destination` | No | Name of the destination bus stop
| `combination_id` | Yes | Name of the combination of timetables.<br/>**Default**: `ABCz`

## STATE AND ATTRIBUTES
### STATE
The next connection short description in format *time (bus line)*. If there are line changes to be made, the status will only show the first connection (see attribute description for the complete plan)

### ATTRIBUTES
| Attribute | Description
|:---------|-----------
| `departure` | Departure time
| `line` | Bus line (1st one if there are more connections - for more look in the description)
| `connections` | List of the connections to take (or simply line number if this is a direct connection)
| `duration` | Trip duration
| `delay` | Dlayed connections (including the line number and the delay)
| `description` | Full description of the connections - each connection on 1 line, in the format<br/>*line time (bus stop to get-in) -> time (bus stop to get-off)   (!!! delay if applicable)*,<br/>or as a HTML table
| `detail` | A list of 2 connections. Each connection is a dictionary of values (see the example below)

## SERVICE sensor.set_start_time
Set the time to start searching for connections

| Attribute | Description
|:---------|-----------
| `entity_id` | ID of the sensor (e.g. `sensor.bus_to_work`)
| `start_time` | The starting time (e.g. `'19:30'`). Call the service without this parameter to remove the start time (search from the current time)


## ADVANCED - parsing list description
From the **detail attribute** you can access the attributes of the individual connections (there are 2 connections)
### You can display them like that this example (for sensor entity_id sensor.cz_pub_tran)
```yaml
{{ states.sensor.cz_pub_tran.attributes["detail"][0] }}
```

### Result:
```
[{'line': '241', 'depTime': '23:08', 'depStation': 'Zbraslavsk√© n√°mƒõst√≠', 'arrTime': '23:17', 'arrStation': 'Lihovar', 'delay': ''}, {'line': '5', 'depTime': '23:24', 'depStation': 'Lihovar', 'arrTime': '23:33', 'arrStation': 'Poliklinika Barrandov', 'delay': ''}]
```

### Or you can parse them using scipt:
```yaml
{% for index in [0,1] %}
Connection {{index+1}}
  {% for bus in states.sensor.cz_pub_tran.attributes["detail"][index] %}
    Line: {{ bus["line"] }}
    Departure time {{ bus["depTime"] }} from {{ bus["depStation"] }}
    Arrival time {{ bus["arrTime"] }} to {{ bus["arrStation"] }}
    {%- if bus["delay"] != "" %}
      Current delay {{ bus["delay"] }} min
    {% endif %}
  {% endfor %}
{% endfor %}
```

### Result
```
Connection 1
  
    Line: 129
    Departure time 22:48 from Zbraslavsk√© n√°mƒõst√≠
    Arrival time 22:57 to Lihovar
  
    Line: 5
    Departure time 23:04 from Lihovar
    Arrival time 23:13 to Poliklinika Barrandov
  

Connection 2
  
    Line: 241
    Departure time 23:08 from Zbraslavsk√© n√°mƒõst√≠
    Arrival time 23:17 to Lihovar
  
    Line: 5
    Departure time 23:24 from Lihovar
    Arrival time 23:33 to Poliklinika Barrandov
```
